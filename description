Our project's name is ESTÜPost. In this project there will be a mobile application. Application lets people who are student at
Eskişehir Technical University to interract with each other. Basicly, users will be able to create posts. Purpose of the project is to
provide a platform that students can ask for everything about lessons or school. Besides, proffessors from ESTÜ also will be able to
use the system but they will not be able to view every posts. For students, there will be an option to determine if proffesors can view
the post. Also, proffesors will have authorisation to create events. There will be a tab for these events. Besides, posts will not
have to be about lessons or the school. It will be free to post about daily events, sports or anything else. Users will be have to use
their real names.
